Nowadays mobile users tend to expect desktop-level performance on their mobile device. Unfortunately the current mobile device resources shortage imposes several limits on their processing capabilities. In order to meet these new requirements industry has been progressively borrowing desktop hardware components, such as GPUs and integrate them into mobile device architecture. On the other side much research has been devoted to leverage cloud resources to augment mobile devices. The main drawback of the approach lies in its network transfer cost that tend to drastically limit the performance improvements.

In this paper we take advantage of GPGPU parallel processing technique to propose a solution that combines the advantage of the workload offloading technique and alleviates the data transfer cost. Our approach relies on a method that dynamically partition the computation and dispatch the workload between heterogeneous local and remote resources. Our experiment shows that such approach increases the the utilization of mobile and server resources, and reduces significantly the amount data that need to be transferred.
