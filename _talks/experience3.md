* Worked on a Cloud OS system, and more specifically on the Physical Resource Management node (PRM), which provides the foundation software services(PXE,DHCP, DNS, kickstart, etc), and manage the deployment of the Cloud OS.
   * Main objectives:
      * Improving the Cloud OS deployment system to make it dynamical.
      * Speeding up the Cloud OS deployment system. The solution proposed is to create an image from scratch and to remotely install it on our cluster using rsync, Multicast, or BitTorrent transport.
      * Researching a way to provides a diskless environment for client machines.
