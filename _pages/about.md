My name is Olivier Valery. I come from France. Currently I am a Ph.D candidate at National Taiwan University<sup>1</sup> 

My current research focuses on applying parallel processing techniques on mobile device heterogeneous architecture (CPU and GPU) in order to locally perform machine learning tasks, such as Deep Learning training and prediction.

My domain of expertise consists in a strong knowledge of mobile device SoC architecture (including multicores CPU and GPU) combined to good understanding of modern deep learning techniques (DNN, CNN, RNN, GAN, BNN ...) and a smart utilization of parallel computing approaches, such as GPGPU techniques (CUDA, OpenCL). 

Recently I have been involved in several computer vision projects. The source are available on my github. Feel free to contact me for any job/collaboration opportunity.
